Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.

ANSWER:

Use 2 pointers
  -> iterate through all bits
  -> one moves from right end to left ( reversed)
  -> another moves from left to right (n itself)
  -> At each point 'and' with 1 to get the last bit and if it's 1, then add 1 to reversed.
  
  
  public class Solution {
    // you need treat n as an unsigned value
    public int reverseBits(int n) {
        int reversed = 0;
        
        for(int i =0; i<32; i++){
            reversed = reversed<<1;
            if((n&1)==1)reversed++;
            n = n>>1;
        }
        return reversed;
    }
}
