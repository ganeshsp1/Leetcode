Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

Note:

Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, the input will be given as a signed integer type. It should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using 2's complement notation. Therefore, in Example 3, the input represents the signed integer. -3.
 
Example 1:

Input: n = 00000000000000000000000000001011
Output: 3
Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000000001011 has a total of three '1' bits.



ANSWER :
Solution 1) Use Integer.toBinaryString(n) and then find the 1's.
Solution 2) For any bit if you and it with a mask of only one '1' then you can get the least significant bit at that location and check if that is '1', then add to count.
Solution 3) For any integer n, if you 'and' it with n-1 you will change the lest significant 1 to 0, Go till n==0 and keep changing n to n&n-1.

public class Solution {
    // you need to treat n as an unsigned value
    /*public int hammingWeight(int n) {
        String binary = Integer.toBinaryString(n);
        int count = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i<binary.length(); i++){
            if(binary.charAt(i)=='1'){
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
    */
    
    public int hammingWeight(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        while(n!=0){
            count++;
            n = n&(n-1);
        }
        return count;
    }
    
}
